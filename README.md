# Covid Data Exploration (EDA)
This project is about exploring various kinds of data in a large Covid dataset. I have explored both "Covid Deaths" and "Covid Vaccinations" dataset to analyze different relations between the features of them.
By exploring two datasets, I conclude the death of people during covid compared to the total population and infection rate. 
By using "Covid Vaccination" dataset I have maked the relation between death of people and the vaccination. Vaccination ensures the safety of people from different countries.
